# randomQuoteGenerator
freeCodeCamp Project  https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine  


I will be completing this project in the following steps:


1.  Complete the basic HTML.  (Done in my intial Commit)

2.  Plug in data from a quote API

3.  Add the ability to share selected quote on Twitter. 



After these basic requirements have been met I, I will beautify, make responsive and add other nice extras. 
See link above for more details about what I trying to accomplish here.
